# Web Application Framework
A web framework (WF) or web application framework (WAF) is a software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications including web services, web resources, and web APIs. Web frameworks provide a standard way to build and deploy web applications on the World Wide Web. Web frameworks aim to automate the overhead associated with common activities performed in web development. 

**Backend:**  Focusing on server-side logic, data management, and APIs.<br>


- Django (Python):

    Uses: Rapid development of robust, scalable web applications with built-in ORM, admin interface, and authentication support.

- Express.js (JavaScript/Node.js):

    Uses: Building lightweight, fast, and scalable web applications and APIs using JavaScript on the server-side.

- Ruby on Rails (Ruby):

    Uses: Convention-over-configuration framework for developing web applications quickly with minimal boilerplate code.

- Spring Boot (Java):

    Uses: Enterprise-level web application development with comprehensive support for dependency injection, MVC architecture, security, and data access.

- Laravel (PHP):

    Uses: Elegant syntax and a rich set of features for developing PHP web applications, including ORM, routing, middleware, and authentication.

- Flask (Python):

    Uses: Lightweight and flexible framework for building web applications with minimal dependencies and a simple API.

**Frontend:**  Handles user interface (UI) components and client-side interactions.

- React.js:

    Uses: Building dynamic and interactive user interfaces for web applications with reusable components, state management, and a virtual DOM.

- Angular:

    Uses: Comprehensive framework for building large-scale, feature-rich web applications with two-way data binding, dependency injection, and TypeScript support.

- Vue.js:

    Uses: Progressive JavaScript framework for building modern, interactive web interfaces with a focus on simplicity and flexibility.

- Svelte:

    Uses: Compile-time framework for building highly optimized web applications with minimal bundle sizes and efficient updates.

- Ember.js:

    Uses: Opinionated framework for building ambitious web applications with strong conventions, data binding, and a rich ecosystem of addons.

- Backbone.js:

    Uses: Lightweight MVC framework for building single-page web applications with minimal overhead and a flexible structure.
